<b> Compass App</b>

This is a simple compass app for Android built using Kotlin. The app utilizes the device's accelerometer and magnetometer sensors to calculate the orientation and display it as a rotating compass needle on the screen.

Features:

Real-time compass display with smooth rotation animation.
Provides the user with the heading in degrees.
Uses the accelerometer and magnetometer sensors to calculate accurate orientation.
Implements a linear interpolator for smoother animation transitions.
Suitable for both portrait and landscape orientations.
Minimalistic UI design for easy readability.
Getting Started:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.
Rotate the device to observe the compass needle's smooth rotation.
Dependencies:

Android SDK: 21+
Kotlin: 1.5.21
Sensor dependencies are handled in the app's build.gradle file.
Notes:

The app registers listeners for the accelerometer and magnetometer sensors to calculate the orientation.
The rotation animation uses a linear interpolator to achieve smoother transitions.
The compass image is rotated based on the device's orientation.
This app is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates sensor usage and basic animation in Android.
